# Assignment 2: Numerical Integration (README.md)

## Short description:
        This program computes the numerical integration of a function over a specified interval using the composite Simpsonâ€™s rule. This program also contains functions that can return the approximated value of an exponential, sine, cosine, square root, and logarithm function. In other words, this is asmall library of mathematical functions.

## Build
        To build manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o collatz collatz.c" on the command line.
        If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running
        
	./plot.sh, ./integrate 

## Cleaning
        To clean, use "rm -f integrate integrate.o" on the command line.
        If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
