# Assignment 7: Author Identification (README.md)

## Short description:

This assignment requires us to implement a program that attempts to identify the most likely authors for an anonymous sample of text when given a large database of texts with known authors. In other words, we will be using an algorithm thatâ€™s commonly used in machine learning to identify authors of anonymous samples of text. This algorithm is also known as the k-nearest neighbor's algorithm. By utilizing this algorithm, we will classify samples of texts and determine which authors are most likely to have authored an anonymous sample of text.

## Build

To build manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o identify.o identify text.o texts bf.o bv.o ht.o node.o parser.o pq.o speck.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./identify

## Cleaning

        To clean, use "rm identify.o identify text.o  bf.o bv.o ht.o node.o parser.o pq.o speck.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
