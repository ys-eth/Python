# Assignment 3: Sorting (README.md)

## Short description:
        This assignment requires us to implement sorting algorithms like Insertion Sort, Batcher Sort, Heap Sort, and recursive Quicksort for the purpose of us getting fully familiarized with each sorting algorithm. Through this assignment, the program will also sort data using comparisons based on the number of elements needed to be sorted. For example, if the set of elements to be sorted is small, a counting sort is rather to be implemented as it would count the number of occurrences of each element in an array. In addition, by developing this program we will get a feel for computational complexity.

## Build
        To build manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o sorting sorting.c" on the command line.
        If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./plot.sh, ./sorting

## Cleaning
        To clean, use "rm -f sorting sorting.o" on the command line.
        If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
