## Assignment 6: BigInteger ADT (README.md)

## Short description:

In this assignment, we will buildd a BigInteger ADT in C++ that is capable of performing arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large signed integers.

## Build

To build manually, type "Shuffle Shuffle.o ListClient ListClient.o List.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./Arithmetic <input file> <output file>

## Cleaning

To clean, use "rm -f Shuffle Shuffle.o ListClient ListClient.o List.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
