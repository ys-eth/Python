## Assignment 1: Integer List ADT (README.md)

## Short description:

In this program, we are tasked to build an Integer List ADT in C and use it to lexigraphically alphabetize the lines in a file.

## Build

To build manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o Lex.o List.o ListTest.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./Lex <input file> <output file>

## Cleaning

To clean, use "rm -f Lex.o Lex List.o ListTest.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
