## Short description:

In this program, we are tasked to build a Graph ADT in C along with some associated algorithms in order to utilize different methods of representing a graph.

## Build

To build manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o FindPath.o GraphClient.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./FindPath <input file> <output file>
        ./GraphClient <input file> <output file>

## Cleaning

To clean, use "rm -f FindPath.o FindPath GraphClient.o GraphClient" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
