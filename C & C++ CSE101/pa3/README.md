## Assignment 3: Depth First Search (README.md)

## Short description:

In this program, we are tasked to build a Graph module in C that implements the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.

## Build

To build manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o FindComponents.o GraphClient.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./FindComponents <input file> <output file>
        ./GraphClient <input file> <output file>

## Cleaning

To clean, use "rm -f GraphClient.o GraphClient FindComponents.o FindComponents" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
