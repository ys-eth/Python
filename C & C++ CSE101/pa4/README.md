## Assignment 4: Matrix Calculator (README.md)

## Short description:

In this program, we are tasked to create a calculator for perofming matrix operations that exploits the expected sparseness of its matrix operands.

## Build

To build manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o Sparse.o MatrixClient.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./Sparse <input file> <output file>
        ./MatrixClient

## Cleaning

To clean, use "rm -f Sparse MatrixClient MatrixTest ListTest Sparse.o MatrixClient.o MatrixTest.o ListTest.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
