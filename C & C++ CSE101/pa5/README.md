## Assignment 5: The Perfect Shuffle (README.md)

## Short description:

In this program, we are tasked to perform a perfect shuffle using the List ADT. In terms of a deck of cards, we are asked to perform a shuffle by splitting it evenly and then merging the deck by alternatively inserting cards from each half into the new deck.

## Build

To build manually, type "Shuffle Shuffle.o ListClient ListClient.o List.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "make" on the command line with the Makefile from the directory.

## Running

        ./Shuffle

## Cleaning

To clean, use "rm -f Shuffle Shuffle.o ListClient ListClient.o List.o" on the command line. If this doesn't work, type "clean" on the command line.
